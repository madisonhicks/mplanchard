# Projects

Below you'll find some of my open-source projects. You can find me on
GitHub at [@mplanchard](https://github.com/mplanchard).

I'm a big believer in open source software, good documentation, and thorough
testing. I welcome contributions of all sizes to any of the open source 
projects that I have written or manage!

## Open-Source: Author

* [PyDecor](https://github.com/mplanchard/pydecor) - easy-peasy Python decorators
* [falcon-marshmallow](https://github.com/ihiji/falcon-marshmallow) - automatic
marshmallow (de)serialization for web requests in the Falcon framework
* [version-utils](https://github.com/ihiji/version_utils) - pure Python RedHat
package version parsing and comparison


## Open-Source: Contributor

* [pypiserver](https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver) - custom Python package
server, compatible with `pip`

## Private Work

In addition to the public projects above, I have written a great deal of
software for [Ihiji](https://www.ihiji.com), including the following projects:

* Python socket server to parse JSON dictionaries generated by Perl scripts
and spin up new processes dynamically based on the content
* ReSTful API using Flask, which manages both PostgreSQL and Mongo
databases
* Easy-to-implement configuration library that can dynamically parse 
configuration values from Python objects, files (YAML or JSON), and 
environment variables and make them available to applications
* Logging library with sane defaults and the ability to easily specify log 
levels for multiple loggers
* Decorator-based library for protecting API endpoints, making decisions
based on the parsing of local rules, a policy file, and user roles populated
in HTTP request headers
* WSGI middleware package to automatically validate request authentication,
integrating with OpenStack technology, and to populate user information in
request headers and the WSGI environ prior to passing it on
* Abstraction layer over a variety of database drivers, providing both a
unified interface to both SQL & NoSQL datastores and automatic validation of
input data using Marshmallow schemas
* Stripe webhook handler, written in Flask
* Co-developed a React Native iOS/Android mobile application
* Lots of Ansible roles
* From-scratch server cluster using Ansible for easy scaling, including
load balancers (haproxy), API servers, rabbit and redis brokers, and celery 
workers
* Promoted, designed, and managed a CI system for continuous testing/deployment
of new code (Jenkins, Travis)
* Deployed a custom Python package server using [pypiserver](https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver)
