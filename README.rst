A Personal, Experimental Website
================================

This repo contains a server & static code to serve a small, personal
website, whose primary focus is to provide a place for experimentation
with new (to me) ideas, frameworks, etc.

This project is distributed under an MIT license, so anyone may, free of
charge, use any portion of the code contained herein for whatever they
so choose.
